<!--
**xRiku/xRiku** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->
- 🌱 I’m currently working for MedPrev as a Full-stack Developer
- 🙏 I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo
- 🚀 I'm studying NestJS and Vue.Js

  My github will get less updated since i'm working using azure now
