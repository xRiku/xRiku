# Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="14px" alt="hi">


- 🌱 I’m currently working for MedPrev as a Full-stack Developer
- 🙏 I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo
- 🚀 I'm working mainly with React (Next.js), but I also work with Vue (2 and 3 in our legacy system), React Native in our app and NestJS in our REST API.
- 🔥 I'm hyped with code again
- 🎉 Been having so much fun with pickleball 😄

 I'll be trying my hardest to improve my knowledge as a software engineer and keep getting higher
